# Space Y Capstone Project

## Project Introduction

### Project Scenario and Overview
The commercial space age is rapidly advancing, making space travel more accessible and affordable than ever before. Companies such as Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, and SpaceX are pioneering the future of space exploration and rocket launches. Among these, SpaceX has set new benchmarks with its innovative approaches to space travel.

### SpaceX's Achievements
SpaceX has made significant strides in space exploration, including:
- **Sending spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS)**: SpaceX has successfully delivered supplies and astronauts to the ISS, playing a crucial role in maintaining and advancing space exploration.
- **Starlink Satellite Internet Constellation**: SpaceX is building a network of low Earth orbit satellites to provide global high-speed internet access.
- **Manned Space Missions**: SpaceX has successfully launched and returned manned missions, demonstrating its capability in human spaceflight.

### Cost of SpaceX Falcon 9 Rocket Launches
SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket has revolutionized the cost of space launches. The company advertises launches at a price of $62 million, which is significantly more affordable compared to other providers, where costs can exceed $165 million. This cost reduction is largely attributed to the reuse of the Falcon 9's first stage.

### Understanding Falcon 9
The Falcon 9 rocket consists of two stages, with the first stage being the most critical and expensive. The first stage performs the majority of the work during a launch, and SpaceX has developed technology to recover and reuse this stage, though it is sometimes lost or sacrificed depending on the mission.

### Capstone Project
In this capstone project, I will assume the role of a data scientist working for "Space Y," a competitor to SpaceX. The main objectives of this project are:
- **Determine the price of each rocket launch.**
- **Predict whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket.**

The project involves gathering data on SpaceX's launches, performing data analysis, and creating dashboards to visualize the insights. Machine learning techniques will be applied to predict the likelihood of the first stage being reused, aiding Space Y in making strategic decisions.
